A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
CODE:
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int max=nums[0];
        int index=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]>max)
            {
                max=nums[i];
                index=i;
            }
        }
        return index;
        
    }
}
Approach Used in This Code

This solution uses a linear scan approach:
Assume the first element is the maximum
Traverse the array
Whenever a larger element is found, update:
the maximum value
its index
Finally, return the index of the maximum element
